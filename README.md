# Cthulhucraft
After spending 2 months developing the Alpha phase of Aircraft ... here is the beta ..., Cthulhucraft add new bosses, challenges, new objects and new toys lol, new graphics and options in order to have a good gameplay

The goal is to add features that extend the game and story, improve the graphics by taking advantage of the RGB color and resolution engine of Minicraft + "2.0.6", enhance the textures as best as possible, and also add improvements to the interface. texts, menus. etc.

- in short, try to make a more complete version of Minicraft, and make Minicraft more interesting.
- The mod has compatibility with Minicraft plus 2.0.6 (you can load worlds of that version in the mod, but not load worlds from Cthulhucraft to Minicraft).



# Features to implement
